### A Match Between Two Storied Programs

One of the best rivalries in college volleyball was played on Saturday, November 2, 2019. [The seventh-ranked Penn State Nittany Lions (16-3) took on the eigth-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers (16-3)](https://journalstar.com/sports/huskers/volleyball/john-cook-on-the-radio-nebraska-penn-state-match-will/article_c1d5c426-e136-5ef2-b589-510a0f17da82.html). This match featured two of the best middle blockers in the country, Nebraska's Lauren Stivrins and Penn State's Kaitlyn Hord. Stivrins was ranked No. 1 in Big Ten hitting percentage, a .466 before the match up. Hord, close behind, had a hitting percentage of .423 and was ranked towards the top as one of the league's top blockers. 

Alongside being a competition between premier players, this match was set to be a battle between two of the winnigest coaches in NCAA Women's Volleyball history. Russ Rose, head coach of the Nittany Lions, came into the match with a 1289-209 (.860) record, 17 Big Ten Conference Championships, and 7 NCAA National Championships. For the Nebraska Cornhuskers' head coach, John Cook came to the match with a 721-148 (.830) record, 9 Big 12 Conference Championships, 4 Big Ten Conference Championships, and 4 NCAA National Championships. 

Being a contest between two storied programs, premier players, and two of the most winningest coaches in NCAA volleyball history, this match was poised to be one of the premier Big Ten matches in the 2019 season. If history was to serve as a guide, this match would easily go into five exciting, nail-biting sets. Despite having commentators and reporters tell us the story of the game, wouldn't it be interesting to tell the story of what's happening and what fans are talking about during the match? Can what they say allow us to get a pulse of how the fan base feels during the game? 

### Question - What is the story of the game, according to the fans?

This chapter will teach you how to extract, analyze, and visualize [Twitter](www.twitter.com) text data to tell a story about any sport team, player, or event. Although Twitter is conventionally thought of as a social media platform, at a general level it can be thought of as a corpus of textual data, which is generated by millions of users, talking about a wide array of topics over time.

This textual data will be extracted and imported into R through the use of an API (application programming interface). This can seem like a pretty technical term, but all it really is is a portal to which data can be shared between computers and humans. NPR provides an [API 101 post](https://digitalservices.npr.org/post/api-101-what-api) on their site, which you can read to get a rough idea of what an API is, and how they are used. 

In fact, many news organizations provide APIs for people to access and use. Many of these just require you to: a). have a developer account and b). use their API in accordance with their terms of service. For example, many news services like [The New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/api/index), [Associated Press](https://developer.ap.org/) and platforms like [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apis-and-sdks/) have APIs you can use to access content and content metadata. These APIs should have documentation outlining how each can be used. 

This was a pretty handwavy explantion of APIs and their many uses. In fact, APIs have many different uses beyond just extracting data, but such a discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter. Nevertheless, APIs can be a powerful tool to access data not normally available on web pages or statistical services.


## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Twitter account to extract this data. If you do not already have an account, you can sign up for an account [here](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup). 

## Tools for text analysis

This chapter will also require you to load and acquaint yourself with functions in three new packages, `rtweet`, `stringr`, and `tidytext`. [`rtweet`](https://rtweet.info/index.html) is a R package used to access Twitter data via the Twitter API. [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) is a package that provides several functions to make with string data easier. Finally, we will use some functions in the [`tidytext`] package (https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/) to analyze and visualize fan's sentiments. We will also use some of the other packages you have gained familiarity with in the class: `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. To install these packages and load them for use in our session, run the following code:


```r
install.packages("rtweet") # installs the rtweet package

install.packages("tidytext") # installs the tidytext package

install.packages("tidyverse") # A collection of packages, includes the stringr packages

# Load these packages to be used in your session

library(rtweet)

library(tidytext)

library(tidyverse)
```
